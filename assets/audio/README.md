# Audio Assets for Kiddo Fighter

## Music

### Main Scenes

- [x] Title Scene
  - `assets/music/title.ogg`
- [x] Pick Fighter
- [x] Pick Level
  - I assumed we'd carry over the title song into the pick fighter and level scenes
  - If you want to over-achieve, we could have a separate song for the title, pick fighter/level, and then the fight scene
- [x] Fight Scene
  - I think a single song for all levels would be fine

### Levels

- [x] Bakke Backyard
- [x] Everhart Backyard
- [x] Curlew
  - If you want to super, super over-achieve we could do a different song for each level but I assumed they'd all have the same song

### Character Noises

- [x] Character death noise
- [x] Character knockout noise
- [x] Character jump noise
- [x] Character attack noise
- [x] Character block noise
- [x] (maybe) Character walk noise (I've incorporated a sprint so not sure how best to sync up foot steps... I still need to create a sprint animation and I will likely be tunning speed / jump numbers still)

## Effects

- I will largely leave this up to you... I have no idea how difficult it is to generate these noises
- Nice to haves:
- [x] UI element pings for...
  1. Change scene noise:
    - Button press on title screen
    - Confirming character selections
    - Confirming level selection
  2. Moving character/level selection noise
  3. Selecting character/level
