# Audio Assets for Kiddo Fighter

## Music

### Main (Non-Level) Scenes

- [x] Title Scene
  - `assets/music/title.ogg`
- [ ] Pick Fighter
- [ ] Pick Level
  - I assumed we'd carry over the title song into the pick fighter and level scenes
  - If you want to over-achieve, we could have a separate song for the title, pick
    fighter/level, and then the fight scene

### Levels

- [ ] Bakke Backyard
- [ ] Everhart Backyard
- [ ] Curlew
  - If you want to super, super over-achieve we could do a different song for each
    level but I assumed they'd all have the same song

## Effects

### Character Noises

- [ ] Character death
- [ ] Character knockout
- [ ] Character jump
- [ ] Character attack
- [ ] Character block
- [ ] (maybe) Character walk
  - I've incorporated a sprint so not sure how best to sync up foot steps...
  - I still need to create a sprint animation and I will likely be tunning
    speed / jump numbers still)

### UI

I will largely leave this up to you... I have no idea how difficult it is to generate
these noises

- [ ] Change scene noise
- [ ] Button press on title screen
- [x] Confirming character/level selections
  - `assets/sfx/confirm_selection.ogg`
- [ ] Un-confirm character/level selections
  - same as confirm but descending
- [x] Moving character/level selection noise
  - `assets/sfx/change_selection.ogg`
- [x] Invalid selection
  - `assets/sfx/invalid_selection.ogg`
  - general "don't do that!" ui noise
